  // issuing billable API calls; (2) it forced hand-quoting of `--root` because a path
  // with a space (this repo's has one) would split; (3) it emitted a DEP0190
  // deprecation warning on every call. Spawning the vitest CLI with our own node
  // instead removes all three: the timeout now signals the real process, and the
  // argv is passed as an array so no quoting is needed.
  //
  // Consequence worth knowing: `timeout` is now ACTUALLY ENFORCED. Through the shell
  // it was largely decorative — killing cmd.exe left the grandchild holding the stdio
  // pipes, so spawnSync went on waiting for them and a slow suite still finished. A
  // run that genuinely exceeds timeoutMs now comes back status=null, signal=SIGTERM.
